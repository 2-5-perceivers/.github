# 2.5 Perceivers

## Who are we?

Just 2 and a half friends who write code when we come up with ideas. It doesn't matter how good the ideas are.

## Who are you?

I don't know who you are right now. You may be the next contributor to one of our repositories. Don't be shy, drop an issue or PR. We even have Discussions enabled on some of our repositories.

We wouldn't mind expanding the organization if you want, but the name stays.

## Sponsoring

Feel free to sponsor from the popular repositories which have sponsorships enabled. Or (just buy me a coffee)[https://buymeacoffee.com/raresvanca].
